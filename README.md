re:infer programming test

There are two questions in this programming test
 - [`enron`](/enron)
 - [`mcmc-decrypt`](/mcmc-decrypt)

Each is described in a `README.md` file in the corresponding folder. Please
provide your solutions as self contained Python scripts. We use Python 3, but
feel free to use 2.7 if that's what you're more comfortable with.

You can take up to 72h to solve it.

To submit your solutions, push them to a new branch in this repo and create a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
